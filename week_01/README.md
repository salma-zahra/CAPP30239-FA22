Hi, I'm from Pakistan and I'm currently doing my MPP with the Data Analytics certificate from Harris. I worked in management consulting before joining Harris, and creating data visualizations was one of my favorite parts of the job. I'm here to learn more about how I can make data more accessible and palatable for people. I also love food and books written by medical doctors.
