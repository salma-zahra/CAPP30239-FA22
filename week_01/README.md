# Hi! 

I'm from Pakistan :pakistan: .
I love food :stew: , books written by medical doctors :stethoscope: and organizing things :rainbow: .
I'm currently doing my MPP with the Data Analytics certificate from Harris :computer: .
I worked in management consulting before joining Harris, and creating data visualizations :chart_with_upwards_trend: was one of my favorite parts of the job.

 
I'm here to learn more about how I can make data :data: more accessible and beautiful for people.
