# Research topic and interest:

I hope to combine two different data sets to look at global CO2 emmissions and air pollution exposure (measured by exposure to PM2.5 in the atmosphere). Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the air pollutant that poses the greatest risk to health globally, affecting more people than any other pollutant. Chronic exposure to PM2.5 considerably increases the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in particular (OECD). I'm interested in this topic because I want to be able to see how the increase in CO2 emmissions by high income countries is impacting air pollution globally. My only concern is that I have data leading up to 2019/2020. I would have liked more recent data on pollution.

Both the datasets are secondary sources.


## Data set 2: 
###Title: 
Air pollution exposure (Exposure to PM2.5, Micrograms per cubic metre, 2019)
### Description of data:
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the air pollutant that poses the greatest risk to health globally, affecting more people than any other pollutant. Chronic exposure to PM2.5 considerably increases the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in particular. Data refer to population exposure to more than 10 micrograms/m3 and are expressed as annual averages.
