# CAPP30239-FA22

# Hi! 

**Welcome to my GitHub and CAPP30239 repo!**  

I'm from Pakistan :pakistan:  
I'm currently doing my Masters in Public Policy with the Data Analytics certificate from Harris :computer:  
I worked in management consulting before joining Harris, and creating data visualizations :chart_with_upwards_trend:  was one of my favorite parts of the job  
I also love food :stew: and books written by medical doctors :stethoscope:   
 
**I'm here to make data :1234: more accessible and beautiful :bouquet: for people**   

This repo has been created for the Data Visualization and Policy Analysis course for Fall 2022 and will remain in active use from October 2022 to December 2022. This will contain all my class work, assignments and project work. I'm happy to share my code with anyone who might benefit from it, and also receive feedback so I can improve my code.
