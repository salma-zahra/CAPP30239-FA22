# Hi! 

I'm from Pakistan :pakistan: 
I'm currently doing my MPP with the Data Analytics certificate from Harris :computer: 
I worked in management consulting before joining Harris, and creating data visualizations :chart_with_upwards_trend:  was one of my favorite parts of the job
I also love food :stew: and books written by medical doctors :stethoscope: 
 
I'm here to learn more about how I can make data more accessible and palatable for people.
