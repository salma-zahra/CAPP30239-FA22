# CAPP30239-FA22

# Hello! 

**Welcome to my GitHub and CAPP30239 repo! I'm here to make data :1234: more accessible and beautiful :bouquet: for people**   

## Overview  
This repo has been created for the Data Visualization and Policy Analysis course for Fall 2022 and will remain in active use from October 2022 to December 2022. It will contain all my class work, assignments and project work. I'm happy to share my code with anyone who might benefit from it, and also receive feedback so I can improve my code.
