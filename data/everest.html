        About the data:
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <a href= “https://www.himalayandatabase.com/” >Himalayan Databases </a> chronicles all Himalayan Mountain expeditions from 1905 to Spring 2022. The data collection for Everest expeditions was started by Elizabeth Hawley, an American journalist who spent most of her adult life in Kathmandu, Nepal conducting interviews of climbers. In addition to Hawley’s archives, information from books, alpine journals and correspondence with Himalayan climbers has been consolidated to compile records for the Himalayan Database. Detailed information on dates, routes, camps, use of supplemental oxygen, successes, deaths, and accidents is included in the records. They also include biographical information for all the climbers on the expeditions. The data is free and is easily available for exploration from the website.

        I’m from Pakistan which is home to five of the 14 highest mountain peaks in the world, three of which I’ve seen from afar. The mountains have always fascinated and scared me. I’m in awe of them, but they also seem like an insurmountable challenge. I recently saw the documentary “14 peaks” on Netflix and since then I have been trying to figure out why climbers are passionate about high altitude mountaineering. As someone who finding stories from data, I wanted to find out more about the people who are climbing these mountains. That’s how I came across the Himalayan Database. Within the database, I chose to look specifically at Everest expeditions because of how popular they are. During the initial data exploration, I was surprised to find out that almost a third of the climbers on Everest are the Sherpas. In fact, Sherpa Tenzing Norgay was one of the first two people to summit Mount Everest, along with New Zealand’s Edmund Hillary. That’s when I started looking deeper into the incidence of injury and death for Sherpas on Everest. The story unfolding from the data is shocking. I hope that through my analysis and visualization I’m able to communicate how pressing this issue is. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving on to the data analysis and visualization, I used python for exploration and analysis and D3.js for the visualization. I’m comfortable working in Python, but this was my first time working in JavaScript and I struggled quite a bit. There’s a long way for me to go before I can say that I’m confident working in JS, and hopefully this project is just the start. I chose my charts for their simplicity. I have a beeswarm plot, a boxplot, a parallel set and a barchart. The text provides the context, and a quick glance at the charts explains the story. The beeswarm plot and parallel chart are interactive, and the tooltip adds more depth to the information displayed in the chart at first glance.      </p>
      <p>
        The text and charts together tell a story about the strength, resilience, and valor of the Himalayan natives. I hope I was able to do justice to the story.

        Enjoy!

      Who are the Sherpas?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Sherpas are an ethnic group native to the mountainous Himalayan region of Nepal, who are known for their mountaineering aptitude. They have lived on the high plateaus of Himalayas for more than 6000 years. The name “Sherpa” is used to refer to both climbing guides, as well as the ethnic group they belong to. The multimillion-dollar Everest climbing industry in Nepal has been built on the backs of Sherpas who act as guides, secure climbing routes, fix lines and ferry supplies for tourists. Nepal’s tourism industry, largely accounted for by Himalayan treks, is now worth 2.2 billion USD (~10% of Nepal’s GDP). A tourist will pay $45,000 on average to climb Everest. Western guides get to take home around $50,000 each climbing season. Meanwhile, a Sherpa will get paid a paltry $4,000 for the season.

      <h2>
        One third of all people who die on Everest are Sherpas 
      </h2>
      <p>
        311 people have died trying to conquer the highest of the 14 peaks. Climbers battle the physiological and mental challenges of insufficient oxygen, harsh weather, and difficult climbing conditions to reach the summit and back again. Not all of them are successful in the face of these challenges. The reasons for death on Everest vary from natural disasters to fatigue, falls, injuries, and altitude sickness. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From 1999 to 2019, the number of climbers on Everest has more than doubled. Sherpas play a pivotal role in the booming Everest tourism industry – as guides and porters. The take on the responsibility of the safety of the climbers, often at the expense of their own lives. With more inexperienced climbers attempting the ascent, and the climbing routes becoming overcrowded, the death toll on Everest is rising. One third of the casualties on Everest have been Sherpas, despite their considerable mountaineering experience.

      <h2>
        A Sherpa will climb Everest multiple times in their life
      </h2>
      <p>
        The high death toll for Sherpas is especially confounding considering how much mountaineering experience Sherpas have. They climb multiple Himalayan mountains each season, many of which are more treacherous than Everest. While Everest holds the title of the highest peak, Annapurna I in the Himalayas is the deadliest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploration of Everest ascent data shows that on average, each Sherpa climbs Everest 3x in their life, while the average Everest climber will reach the summit once in their lifetime. Three quarters of Sherpas reach the summit 5x during their climbing careers. The highest number of successful Everest summits by a Sherpa have been 23, compared to 15 successful summits by a non-Sherpa climber.

      <h2>
        Why do Sherpas require supplementary oxygen more often than other climbers?
      </h2>
      <p>
        As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which means that climbers have less air to breath. At the summit of Mount Everest, at an elevation of more than 29,000 ft (or 8,848.86 m), climbers will get 33% of the oxygen that is available at sea level. Gradually, the climber’s body acclimatizes to these conditions. The frequency and depth of breathing increases, the heart pumps faster and blood pressure rises. The body works harder to make sure that sufficient oxygen reaches all vital organs. If the body is unable to acclimatize, climbers can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema, and high-altitude pulmonary oedema. Bottled supplementary oxygen can become necessary for survival when the body can’t acclimatize, even at the high cost of $600 per bottle.       </p>
      <p>
        Sherpas are physiologically more suited for the climb since they live in the high Himalayan plateaus at average altitudes of more than 14,700 feet. Their bodies are more used to acclimatizing to the low atmospheric pressure. According to a physiologist at the University of Cambridge, “Sherpas, perform extremely well at altitude — a lot better than we do." It’s surprising then that Sherpas require bottled oxygen much more frequently than other climbers. Less than half of non-Sherpa climbers required bottled oxygen during the expedition, while more than 80% of Sherpas had to use bottled oxygen.

      <h2>
        Sherpas carry much heavier than recommended loads
      </h2>
      <p>
        One reason for the higher supplementary oxygen usage could be that Sherpas are required to carry much heavier loads. A study of Sherpas, all weighing between 100-140 lbs, revealed that a quarter of the male Sherpas carried more than 125% of their body weight during the climb. On average, male Sherpas were carrying nearly 90% of their weight, while their female counterparts were carrying 70% of their body weight. To put this into perspective, climbers are recommended to carry no more than 20% of their body weight.      </p>
      <p>
        This means that Sherpa’s bodies must work much harder at higher altitudes. They need more energy, and hence, more oxygen than the regular climber. This might be why they required supplemental oxygen more frequently than other climbers, despite the exorbitantly high cost of bottled oxygen. The additional load also makes Sherpas more prone to accidents and falls – which are often deadly.       </p>

        If you have the money, you can climb Mount Everest. An Everest climbing expedition can be part of your New Year’s Resolution, a very expensive gift to a loved one, a break from your corporate career, or an adventurous vacation with friends.      </p>
      <p>
        The Everest tourism industry is booming. In 2019, more than 1,100 people tried to summit the mountain during the climbing seasons. It is necessary for the Nepalese government, tour agencies, and existing and aspiring climbers to acknowledge that this expansion is at the expense of Sherpas and their families. Being a Sherpa is one of the riskiest jobs in any sport. The Nepalese government needs to take measures to ensure and promote the safety of Sherpas. Climbing licenses should be given out only after ensuring that the climber will not pose a threat to their life or the Sherpa’s. Stringent restrictions should be placed on the amount of weight that Sherpas are carrying up the mountain. Lastly, relief funds should be set up for Sherpas and their families in case of injury or death.       </p>
      <p>
        In case you are interested in donating to relief efforts for Sherpas, organizations such as the <a href=https://www.sherpasupportfoundation.com/donate>Sherpa Support Foundation</a> and <a href=https://www.sherpafoundation.org/>Sherpa Foundation</a> are providing humanitarian aid to Sherpa communities.      </p>
